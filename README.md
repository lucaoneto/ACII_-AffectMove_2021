# ACII_AffectMove_2021

This is the code used in the [AffectMove 2021 Challenge](http://www.casapaganini.it/entimement/workshops/2021/Workshop2021_Home.php).
Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost are used in the three tasks of the challenge.

The scores obtained on the test sets are:

Task | Algorithm | Accuracy | F1-0 | F1-1 | MCC
---- | --------- | -------- | ---- | ---- | ---
**1**	| **RF** | **0.84** | **0.90** | **0.48** | **0.41**
1	| XGBoost	| 0.83 | 0.90 | 0.48 | 0.40
**2**	| **RF** | **0.67** | **0.79** | **0.30** | **0.14**
2	| XGBoost	| 0.66 | 0.78 | 0.29 | 0.12
3	| RF | 0.76 | 0.76 | 0.76 | 0.53
**3**	| **XGBoost**	| **0.77** | **0.78** | **0.76** | **0.56**
